# Code challenges

This repo (hopefully) will be getting scripts for codechallenges I have worked on.

Most likely there wont be full challenge answers, I don't usually go until the end of challenges, unless it is really interesting for me, but anyway, I think is fun to share and compare solutions.

anything about this can be commented on my email or on twitter (@garaged)
